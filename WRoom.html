    <p>The family-friendly film examines the transformative power of prayer in the Jordan family's lives. Tony and Elizabeth Jordan are a middle-class pair who seem to have it all: good work, a lovely baby, and their ideal house. However, looks may be deceiving. In fact, the Jordans' marriage has devolved into a war zone, with their daughter suffering as a result. Elizabeth learns that she should start battling with her family instead of against them with the aid of Miss Clara, an older, wiser lady. The true adversary of Elizabeth and Tony doesn't have a prayer because of their freshly energized confidence.</p>
